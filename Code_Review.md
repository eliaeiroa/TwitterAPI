On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:
I like the way you show how it is going through the tweets and getting the first 100 tweets and letting the user
press enter to see it at their own pace so they don't get overwhelmed.
The code was well done and done better than I thought of, maybe have it just output what the score is of the two search terms instead of doing each process in segments in the case of the user just wanting the sentiment score.
